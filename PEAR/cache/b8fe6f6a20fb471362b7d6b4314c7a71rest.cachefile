This class helps you generating any XML document you require without the need for DOM.
Furthermore this package can be used as a replacement to serialize() und unserialize() as it comes with a matching XML_Unserializer that is able to create PHP data strcutures (like arrays and objects) from XML documents, if type hints are available.
If you use the XML_Unserialzer on standard XML files, it will try to guess how it has to be unserialized. In most cases it does exactly what you expect it to do. Try reading a RSS file with XML_Unserializer and you have the  whole RSS file in a structured array, similar to XML_RSS.";s:2:"da";s:19:"2003-08-14 19:45:00";s:1:"n";s:279:"Unserializer is now able to unserialize XML files w/o type hints by automatically transforming multiple occurences of the same tag to an indexed array
