This class helps you generating any XML document you require without the need for DOM.
Furthermore this package can be used as a replacement to serialize() und unserialize() as it comes with a matching XML_Unserializer that is able to create PHP data strcutures (like arrays and objects) from XML documents, if type hints are available.
If you use the XML_Unserialzer on standard XML files, it will try to guess how it has to be unserialized. In most cases it does exactly what you expect it to do.
Try reading a RSS file with XML_Unserializer and you have the  whole RSS file in a structured array or even a collection of objects, similar to XML_RSS.
