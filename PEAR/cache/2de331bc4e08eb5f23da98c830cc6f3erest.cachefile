It supports two basic modes of operation: "func" and "event".  In "func" mode, it will look for a function named after each element (xmltag_ELEMENT for start tags and xmltag_ELEMENT_ for end tags), and in "event" mode it uses a set of generic callbacks.

Since version 1.2.0 there's a new XML_Parser_Simple class that makes parsing of most XML documents easier, by automatically providing a stack for the elements.
Furthermore its now possible to split the parser from the handler object, so you do not have to extend XML_Parser anymore in order to parse a document with it.";s:2:"da";s:19:"2010-10-25 15:29:33";s:1:"n";s:31:"Remove package.php from release";s:1:"f";s:5:"16040";s:1:"g";s:40:"http://pear.php.net/get/XML_Parser-1.3.4";s:1:"x";a:1:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:10:"xlink:href";s:17:"package.1.3.4.xml";}}}
