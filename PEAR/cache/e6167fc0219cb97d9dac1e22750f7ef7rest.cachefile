This class helps you generating any XML document you require without the need for DOM.
Furthermore this package can be used as a replacement to serialize() and unserialize() as it comes with a matching XML_Unserializer that is able to create PHP data structures (like arrays and objects) from XML documents, if type hints are available.
If you use the XML_Unserializer on standard XML files, it will try to guess how it has to be unserialized. In most cases it does exactly what you expect it to do.
Try reading a RSS file with XML_Unserializer and you have the whole RSS file in a structured array or even a collection of objects, similar to XML_RSS.

Since version 0.8.0 the package is able to treat XML documents similar to the simplexml extension of PHP 5.";s:2:"da";s:19:"2010-10-25 22:40:39";s:1:"n";s:37:"Bug #17994 	Installed into wrong path";s:1:"f";s:5:"35634";s:1:"g";s:45:"http://pear.php.net/get/XML_Serializer-0.20.2";s:1:"x";a:1:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:10:"xlink:href";s:18:"package.0.20.2.xml";}}}
