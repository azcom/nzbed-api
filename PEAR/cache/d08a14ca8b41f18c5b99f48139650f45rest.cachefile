highly complex transformations are supported. Is was written with
performance in mind and can handle large amounts of data. No XSLT needed!
Major features:

2. minimum effort necessary to get the simple jobs done
3. highly configurable for more complex tasks
4. ISO/IEC 9075-14:2005 support: mapping of SQL identifiers to XML names
5. works with any database that is supported by PEAR DB, PEAR MDB2 or ADOdb

7. debugging, logging and profiling features
8. XML encoding: support for UTF-8, ISO-8859-1 and others
9. in-depth documentation and case studies: tutorials and API documentation
10. 803 phpt unit tests";s:2:"da";s:19:"2007-05-26 08:03:04";s:1:"n";s:512:"This fourth stable release contains only some small enhancements:
