 * Support for multipart/form-data POST requests and file uploads (partly based on Christian Stocker's work)
 * Brackets [] after array variables are optional (on by default, controlled by useBrackets parameter)
 * HTTP_Request now implements a Subject-Observer design pattern. It is possible to add Listeners
   to the Request object to e.g. draw a progress bar when downloading a large file. This is partly
   based on Stefan Walk's work. A usage example for this is available.

Migration to 1.2:
 * Redirect support is now OFF by default
 * Redirect support is DEPRECATED
 * Methods clearCookies(), clearPostData(), reset() are DEPRECATED

Fixes:
 * Fixed PEAR bug #18 (Lowercased headers, fix by Dave Mertens)
 * Fixed PEAR bug #131 (Domain without trailing slash)
 * Fixed PHP bug #25486 (100 Continue handling)
 * Fixed PEAR bug #150 (Notices being generated)
 * Fixed problems with HTTP responses without bodies";s:1:"f";s:5:"11856";s:1:"g";s:40:"http://pear.php.net/get/HTTP_Request-1.2";s:1:"x";a:1:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:10:"xlink:href";s:15:"package.1.2.xml";}}}
