This class helps you generating any XML document you require without the need for DOM.
Furthermore this package can be used as a replacement to serialize() and unserialize() as it comes with a matching XML_Unserializer that is able to create PHP data structures (like arrays and objects) from XML documents, if type hints are available.
If you use the XML_Unserializer on standard XML files, it will try to guess how it has to be unserialized. In most cases it does exactly what you expect it to do.
Try reading a RSS file with XML_Unserializer and you have the whole RSS file in a structured array or even a collection of objects, similar to XML_RSS.

- introduced constants for all options (this helps avoiding typos in the option names)
- deprecated option 'tagName' is no longer supported, use XML_SERIALIZER_OPTION_ROOT_NAME (or rootName) instead
- implement Request #3762: added new ignoreNull option to ignore properties that are set to null when serializing objects or arrays
- fixed bug with encoding function
- use new header comment blocks
