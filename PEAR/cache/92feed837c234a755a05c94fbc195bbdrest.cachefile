  initial patch. Please note that "Connection: close" header is still added
  by default, you need to explicitly add "Connection: Keep-Alive" header or
  remove "Connection" header if using HTTP 1.1
* A new disconnect() method was added which forces disconnection from the 
  server if Keep-Alive is used. Also two new events are sent to the Listeners:
  "connect" and "disconnect"
* Added getUrl() method (request #6589)
* Added method to properly parse header of gzip-encoded data (see RFC 1952).
  This takes care of situations when the server adds some additional data
  to the header (bug #8245) or sends data that is not gzip-encoded when
  "Content-Encoding: gzip" header is present (bug #8213)
* "Proxy-Authorization" header is now properly set by constructor
  (bug #5913)
* Fixed doc comments mentioning addBody() method instead of proper setBody()
  (bug #5969)
* Fixed erroneous removal of "Content-Type" header from request
  (bug #7922)
* Bogus HTTP headers are now ignored (bug #8214)
* Path is set to "/" if an URL without path (http://www.example.com)
  is given (bug #8662)
