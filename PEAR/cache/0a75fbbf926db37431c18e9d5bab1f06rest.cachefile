======
* Adjusted cache headers to force IE to revalidate
* Attempt to fix Bug #2110 (long delay until "Save as..." popup)

Features:
=========
+ Added the possibility to send HTTP responses 
  without a "Content-Disposition" header
+ Implemented kind of a throttling mechanism
  This can be done by setting $bufferSize through 
  HTTP_Download::setBufferSize($bytes) and adjusting $throttleDelay
  through HTTP_Download::setThrottleDelay($seconds), e.g. a
  buffer size of 25600 bytes and a throttle delay of 1 second
  will lead to a download rate of approximatly 25 KB/s.";s:1:"f";s:4:"7729";s:1:"g";s:44:"http://pear.php.net/get/HTTP_Download-0.10.0";s:1:"x";a:1:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:10:"xlink:href";s:18:"package.0.10.0.xml";}}}
